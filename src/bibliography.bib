  abstract = "Long-distance entanglement distribution is essential for both
              foundational tests of quantum physics and scalable quantum
              networks. Owing to channel loss, however, the previously achieved
              distance was limited to ~100 kilometers. Here we demonstrate
              satellite-based distribution of entangled photon pairs to two
              locations separated by 1203 kilometers on Earth, through two
              satellite-to-ground downlinks with a summed length varying from
              1600 to 2400 kilometers. We observed a survival of two-photon
              entanglement and a violation of Bell inequality by 2.37 $\pm$
              0.09 under strict Einstein locality conditions. The obtained
              effective link efficiency is orders of magnitude higher than that
              of the direct bidirectional transmission of the two photons
              through telecommunication fibers.",

abstract={We study chaos and scrambling in unitary channels by considering their entanglement properties as states. Using out-of-time-order correlation functions to diagnose chaos, we characterize the ability of a channel to process quantum information. We show that the generic decay of such correlators implies that any input subsystem must have near vanishing mutual information with almost all partitions of the output. Additionally, we propose the negativity of the tripartite information of the channel as a general diagnostic of scrambling. This measures the delocalization of information and is closely related to the decay of out-of-time-order correlators. We back up our results with numerics in two non-integrable models and analytic results in a perfect tensor network model of chaotic time evolution. These results show that the butterfly effect in quantum systems implies the information-theoretic definition of scrambling.},

abstract = {Well-controlled systems, such as cold atomic gases, can simulate more complicated materials. Applying this quantum simulation concept to the study of magnetism, Alvarez et al. add an interesting twist. Instead of cold atoms, a network of nuclear spins of hydrogen in polycrystalline adamantane serves as a simulator. Using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, the authors could induce a transition from a state in which all spins coupled to each other to a state in which coherent spins grouped into clusters. Science, this issue p. 846 Nuclear magnetic resonance techniques are used to simulate the dynamics of dipolar interactions. Nonequilibrium dynamics of many-body systems are important in many scientific fields. Here, we report the experimental observation of a phase transition of the quantum coherent dynamics of a three-dimensional many-spin system with dipolar interactions. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on a solid-state system of spins at room-temperature, we quench the interaction Hamiltonian to drive the evolution of the system. Depending on the quench strength, we then observe either localized or extended dynamics of the system coherence. We extract the critical exponents for the localized cluster size of correlated spins and diffusion coefficient around the phase transition separating the localized from the delocalized dynamical regime. These results show that NMR techniques are well suited to studying the nonequilibrium dynamics of complex many-body systems.}}

abstract = {Bell’s theorem shows that local realistic theories place strong restrictions on observable correlations between different systems, giving rise to Bell’s inequality which can be violated in experiments using entangled quantum states. Bell’s theorem is based on the assumptions of realism, locality, and the freedom to choose between measurement settings. In experimental tests, “loopholes” arise which allow observed violations to still be explained by local realistic theories. Violating Bell’s inequality while simultaneously closing all such loopholes is one of the most significant still open challenges in fundamental physics today. In this paper, we present an experiment that violates Bell’s inequality while simultaneously closing the locality loophole and addressing the freedom-of-choice loophole, also closing the latter within a reasonable set of assumptions. We also explain that the locality and freedom-of-choice loopholes can be closed only within nondeterminism, i.e., in the context of stochastic local realism.}}

As the degree of violation increases beyond different threshold values, or strata, this witness can guarantee that no more than M qubits are separable from the rest of the state for any M⩽N, or that there is some genuine M-party or greater multipartite entanglement present. We illustrate the use our criterion by investigating the existence of entanglement in thermal stabilizer states, where we demonstrate that the witness is capable of witnessing bound-entangled states. Intriguingly, this entanglement can be shown to persist in the thermodynamic limit at arbitrary temperature.}

The resulting criteria are necessary and sufficient for certain families of states. This, for example, completely solves the problem of classifying N-qubit Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger states mixed with white noise according to their separability and entanglement properties. Further, the criteria are superior to all known entanglement criteria for many other families; also they allow the detection of bound entanglement. We next demonstrate that they are easily implementable in experiments and discuss applications to the decoherence of multiparticle entangled states.}

This concept is defined as permitting calculation of the accuracy of future experimental results solely on the basis of the number of runs whose data will serve as input for making the prediction. Each probability is transformed to an associated variable whose uncertainty interval depends only on the amount of data and strictly decreases with it. We find that for a probability which is a function of two other probabilities maximum predictive power is achieved when linearly summing their associated variables and transforming back to a probability. This recovers the quantum mechanical superposition principle.},

abstract={The uncertainty of an observable in a quantum state is usually described by variance. This description is well suited when the states are pure. But when the states are mixed, things become subtle, and the variance is a hybrid of quantum and classical uncertainties. Motivated by the notion of Fisher information in statistical inference, we establish a decomposition of the variance into quantum and classical parts. The key observation is that the Wigner-Yanase skew information (a distinguished version of quantum Fisher information) can be interpreted as a measure of quantum uncertainty. We also establish a decomposition of the conventional covariance into quantum and classical parts. The results provide a new perspective for understanding uncertainty and correlation and are used to quantify entanglement, as well as to establish a new uncertainty relation in purely quantum terms.},

It was later recognized that skew information in addition to its original significance as a measure of the information content of states admits several interpretations of a more physical and information theory nature. This quantity has now found many applications in quantum information. An intriguing and subtle feature of skew information is the involvement of the square root of quantum states (density operators). Comparing skew information with some of its natural modifications reveals mathematical and also physical reasons for using the square root. We further use skew information to quantify the asymmetry of quantum states with respect to group representations.},

It is shown that this measure not only has good computability but also eliminates the noncontractivity problem appearing in the original measure of MIN defined by the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. The analytical formulas of MIN based on Wigner-Yanase skew information for any pure states, -dimensional mixed states, and some higher-dimensional symmetric states are presented. Furthermore, the tight upper bound to MIN based on Wigner-Yanase skew information in the general case is also derived.}

	abstract = {In quantum mechanics, quantum coherence of a state relative to a quantum measurement can be identified with the quantumness that has to be destroyed by the measurement. In particular, quantum coherence of a bipartite state relative to a local quantum measurement encodes quantum correlations in the state. If one takes minimization with respect to the local measurements, then one is led to quantifiers which capture quantum correlations from the perspective of coherence. In this vein, quantum discord, which quantifies the minimal correlations that have to be destroyed by quantum measurements, can be identified as the minimal coherence, with the coherence measured by the relative entropy of coherence. To advocate and formulate this idea in a general context, we first review coherence relative to Lüders measurements which extends the notion of coherence relative to von Neumann measurements (or equivalently, orthonomal bases), and highlight the observation that quantum discord arises as minimal coherence through two prototypical examples. Then, we introduce some novel measures of quantum correlations in terms of coherence, illustrate them through examples, investigate their fundamental properties and implications, and indicate their applications to quantum metrology.}

The scaling exponent of the lower bound of skew information closely relates to the correlation length of the model and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction shifts the factorization point.

The Gaussian model of distribution of MQ coherence intensities was used to determine the effective 1H spin cluster size (N). The growth of the effective cluster size with the time of excitation of MQ NMR coherences τ indicates the uniform distribution of organic moieties in the studied gels, but the growth rate is significantly slower than that of adamantane which was used for comparison as an example of the systems with uniform distribution of 1H spins. The growth rate was described by the exponents α in the scaling law of the form N~τα. The obtained values of α were 3.07 for adamantane, 1.27 for aerogel and 1.8 for QM resins. This difference was attributed to the surface distribution of the 1H spins in the studied gels. The growth rate of spin clusters in aerogel is slower in comparison with QM resins with different content of 1H spins which show similar growth rate among each other. This result was explained by the higher local concentration of 1H spins on the surfaces of silica regions in QM resins.}

abstract={Multiple-quantum (MQ) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to characterize the proton distribution in methyltrimethoxysilane gel (MS gel, [CH3SiO3/2]n) and octavinylsilsesquioxane (OVS, [CH2=CHSiO3/2]8). The Gaussian model of distribution of MQ coherence intensities was used to determine the effective 1H spin-cluster size (N). The growth rate was described by the exponents $\alpha$ in the scaling law of the form N{\thinspace}{\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}$\tau$$\alpha$. The obtained values of $\alpha$ were 1.65 for MS gel and 1.78 for OVS. The magnitudes of the growth exponents were compared to the previously obtained values for hybrid organic--inorganic gels. The influence of the dipolar coupling strength and the arrangement of spins in these systems on the growth of MQ NMR coherences is discussed. The shape of MQ NMR coherence profiles was investigated. It was found that the intensity profiles of MQ NMR coherences at different excitation times in the investigated hybrid silica gels are similar and may be well approximated by a stretched exponential function.},

[3]] and the experimental progress towards its realization are discussed. We emphasize the importance of revisiting a wide range of isotope effects which have been explored over the past several decades for the construction of solid-state silicon quantum computers. Using RF decoupling techniques [T.D. Ladd, D. Maryenko, Y. Yamamoto, E. Abe, K.M. Itoh, Phys. Rev. B. 71 (2005) 014401] phase decoherence times T2=25s of 29Si nuclear spins in single-crystal Si have been obtained at room temperature. We show that a linear chain of 29Si stable isotopes with nuclear spin I=1/2 embedded in a spin free 28Si stable isotope matrix can form an ideal building block for solid-state quantum information processors, especially, in the form of a quantum memory which requires a large number of operations within T2 for the continuous error correction.}

abstract = {Intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions were once thought to average to zero in gases and liquids as a result of rapid molecular motion that leads to sharp nuclear magnetic resonance lines. Recent papers have shown that small residual couplings survive the motional averaging if the magnetization is nonuniform or nonspherical. Here, we show that a much larger, qualitatively different intermolecular dipolar interaction remains in nanogases and nanoliquids as an effect of confinement. The dipolar coupling that characterizes such interactions is identical for all spin pairs and depends on the shape, orientation (with respect to the external magnetic field), and volume of the gas/liquid container. This nanoscale effect is useful in the determination of nanostructures and could have unique applications in the exploration of quantum space.}}

The restoring protocol is based on the specially constructed unitary transformation applied to the state of the extended receiver. This transformation for a given length of the chain and Hamiltonian is universally optimal in the sense that ones constructed it can be applied to optimally restore any higher-order coherence matrices.}

For an initial state with polarization localized on a single spin, Ijz, the dimension of the accessible Liouville subspace grows with N2. The polarization propagates along the chain in the form of spin-wave packets that gradually split into sub-packets bouncing back and forth at the ends. The initially regular appearance turns at longer times into an erratic behavior due to the complex interference of the spin-wave packets. Even for large N and long times the density operator exhibits large-amplitude fluctuations about its long-term average, which is non-ergodic in the sense that it is dependent on the initial conditions of the dynamics.}

abstract={Multiple quantum (MQ) NMR coherence spectra, which can be obtained experimentally in MQ NMR, can be transferred from the sender to the remote receiver without mixing the MQ coherences of different orders and distortions. The only effect of such transfer is scaling of the certain blocks of sender's density matrix (matrices of MQ coherences of different orders). Such a block-scaled transfer is an alternative to the perfect state transfer. In particular, equal scaling of higher-order MQ coherences matrices is possible. Moreover, there are states which can be transferred to the receiver preserving their zero-order coherence matrix. The examples of block-scaled transfer in spin-1/2 communication lines of 6 and 42 nodes with two-qubit sender and receiver are presented.},

abstract={Entanglement is studied in an open alternating chain of nuclear spins s = 1/2 with spin-spin couplings in an external magnetic field under the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. A reduced density matrix has been calculated for an arbitrarily chosen spin pair. The entanglement of the spin pair has been estimated according to the Wootters criterion. The temperature at which an entangled state appears in a chosen pair has been determined. It has been shown that the numerical characteristics of the entanglement are oscillating functions of the position of the spin pair in the chain.},

Therewith we use a physically motivated initial condition with the pure state of the sender and the thermodynamical equilibrium state of the other nodes. The main part of the creatable region is a one-to-one map of the initial state (control) parameters, except the small subregion twice covered by the control parameters, which appears owing to the chosen initial state. The polarization and coherence intensity behave differently in the state creation process. In particular, the coherence intensity cannot reach any significant value unless the polarization is large in long chains (unlike the short ones), but the opposite is not true. The coherence intensity vanishes with an increase in the chain length, while the polarization (by absolute value) is not sensitive to this parameter. We represent several characteristics of the creatable polarization and coherence intensity and describe their relation to the parameters of the initial state. The link to the eigenvalue--eigenvector parametrization of the receiver's state space is given.},

Studying the available exactly solvable models clarifies many aspects of the quantum information. In this study, we consider two exactly solvable models in the MQ NMR experiment: (i) the isolated system of two spin- particles (dimers) and (ii) the large system of equivalent spin- particles in a nanopore. The former model is used to describe the quantum correlations and their relations with the MQ NMR coherences, whereas the latter helps one to model the creation and decay of large clusters of correlated particles. }

We show that the OTOC decreases in power law in a many-body localized system at the scrambling time. We also find that the OTOC can also be used to distinguish a many-body localized phase from an Anderson localized phase, while a normal correlator cannot. Furthermore, we prove an exact theorem that relates the growth of the second Rényi entropy in the quench dynamics to the decay of the OTOC in equilibrium. This theorem works for a generic quantum system. We discuss various implications of this theorem.}

               between nearest neighbors having the same constants is used to
               obtain exact expressions for the intensities of the
               multiple-quantum coherences in the spin systems studied, which
               are initially in thermal equilibrium and whose evolution is
               described by a two-spin two-quantum Hamiltonian. An
               approximation of nearest neighbors with arbitrary dipole-dipole

               between the multiple-quantum dynamics and the dynamics of spin

               to calculate the intensities of multiple-quantum coherences in

               obtained to expand the matrix of the two-spin two-quantum

For any number n of qubits, they determine an orthogonal basis consisting of maximally entangled states generalizing the Bell states.}

               applied to the detection of signals in random noise. Density
               operators take the place of the probability density functions of
               conventional statistics. The optimum procedure for choosing
               between two hypotheses, and an approximate procedure valid at
               small signal-to-noise ratios and called threshold detection, are
               presented. Quantum estimation theory seeks best estimators of
               parameters of a density operator. A quantum counterpart of the
               Cram{\'e}r-Rao inequality of conventional statistics sets a
               lower bound to the mean-square errors of such estimates.
               Applications at present are primarily to the detection and
               estimation of signals of optical frequencies in the presence of

Combining with the corresponding expression of the quantum Fisher information, we rigorously prove that the fidelity susceptibility is proportional to the quantum Fisher information. As this proof can be naturally extended to the full rank case, this proportional relation is generally established for density matrices with arbitrary ranks. Furthermore, we give an analytical expression of the quantum Fisher information matrix, and show that it can also be represented in the density matrix’s support.}

               dynamics are investigated analytically in infinite
               one-dimensional (1D) chains of spins 1/2. The representation of
               spin 1/2 operators with fermion field operators allows to
               calculate exactly the spin density operator, and hence NMR
               observables, under a variety of different conditions for 1D spin
               systems. The exact expressions are valid for all times and for a
               macroscopic number of coupled spins. The calculations for a 1D
               spin system initially at thermal equilibrium, and evolving under
               a 2-quantum/2-spin average dipolar Hamiltonian, in the presence
               of nearest-neighbor dipolar interactions yield MQ NMR spectra
               with 0- and 2-quantum coherences only. For a nonequilibrium
               initial condition with transverse magnetization, the analogous
               spin dynamics calculations produce MQ NMR spectra with all
               possible coherences of odd orders. Calculations at the level of
               perturbation theory, which include next-nearest-neighbor dipolar
               interactions, generate MQ spectra with higher even order
               coherences for equilibrium initial condition and evolution under

We study MQ NMR dynamics of one-dimensional systems (chains and rings) and nano-voids filled with spin-carrying atoms or molecules in a strong external magnetic field. Our focus is the problem of the profile of MQ NMR coherences (i.e., the dependence of the intensities of MQ NMR coherences on their orders). We find that integrable one-dimensional systems exhibit peculiar behavior that does not shed much light on a more generic situation. On the other hand, important lessons can be extracted from our solution for the nano-scale systems. We find that the profile of the intensities of the MQ NMR coherences is rather exponential than Gaussian as was proposed earlier. We also address the cluster growth in the course of the evolution of MQ NMR coherences.},

Here, we introduce a new quasi-one-dimensional chain of spin-1/2 1H nuclei in hambergite (Be2BO3(OH)) crystal. The distinctive feature of hambergite is the zig-zag arrangement of the spins in the chains compared to the systems reported earlier. A single crystal of hambergite was investigated experimentally using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance at different orientations in the external magnetic field. The experimental spectra were compared with the Van Vleck’s second moments calculated from the structural data. For the orientation of the chain along the external magnetic field the resonance resembles that of the linear spin chains and the calculated contributions to the second moment from spins within one chain of hambergite amount to 96%. For other orientations the spectra demonstrate features specific to the zig-zag chain. Our results show that 1H nuclei in hambergite crystals could serve a good model of a well-isolated zig-zag spin chain.}
